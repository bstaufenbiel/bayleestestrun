The topic modeling tool is less than zesty. It probably works better with larger data samples that have more variation in their subject matter and text characters. The topics that occurred in my corpus were all very similar and expected regardless of how little or many topics that I asked for. 

Instead, I took this opportunity to use Voyant-Tools as it also does a similar form of Topic Modeling. Since Voyant is "silver/basement-group" friendly, I was able to sift through words to get word-closeness and frequency data as a different way to judge topic variation. Voyant also allowed me to easily get render a visualization which was not happening with the topic modeling tool. Just looking at the key words and the topics that occured within this corpus, I can see that many of the infants in these infanticide cases were alive at birth. The bedroom and kitchen were popular rooms that births took place. Often someone overheard or saw the "prisoner" with the child or in the labor process. Keywords, however, can be misleading as a common word that popped up was "guilty." Only three of the twelve entries that I compiled had a guilty verdict, but one entry did use the term conversationally. 

Overall there are benefits to topic modeling, but as with everthing we need to make sure that we are aware of the data that we are entering and not making overgeneralized conclusions on little information.
