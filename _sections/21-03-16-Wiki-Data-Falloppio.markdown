Wiki-Data is interesting and has a wide variety of benefits, but it is also slightly frustrating depending on the topic that someone is working with. In my particular case I was attempting to search "notable works" of anatomists. When I noticed that a very famous work of anatomist Gabriele Falloppio was missing, I went to add it to his wiki-data page. However, upon attempting to add the <em>notable work</em> statement, the text I was hoping to add was unfindable. I then had to go create a whole new entry for the medical treatise that I wanted to attribute to this author. When I was adding the text, <em>Observationes Anatomicæ</em> the label did not want to work because the name of the text was in Latin. I then, instead of figuring out how to add a latin label, just created a label with the translated name and the Latin in parentheses. After making the new entry, I then went back to Falloppio's wiki-data page and was able to add a statement with notable work where the entry came up properly.
