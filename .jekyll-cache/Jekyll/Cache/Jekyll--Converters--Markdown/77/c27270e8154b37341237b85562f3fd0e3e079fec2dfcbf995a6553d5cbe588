I"π<p>The topic modeling tool is less than zesty. It probably works better with larger data samples that have more variation in their subject matter and text characters. I took this oppertunity to use Voyant-Tools instead as it also does a similar form of Topic Modeling. Since Voyant is ‚Äúsilver/basement-group‚Äù friendly I was able to sift through words to get a better data visualization than I would have if only using the topic modeling tool and making my own visualization via R, Palladio, or something else. Just looking at the key words I can see that many of the infants in these infanticide cases were alive at birth. The bedroom and kitchen were popular rooms that births took place. Often someone overheard or saw the ‚Äúprisoner‚Äù with the child or in the labor process. Keywords, however, can be misleading as a common word that popped up was ‚Äúguilty.‚Äù Only three of the twelve entries that I compiled had a guilty verdict, but one entry did use the term conversationally.</p>

<p>Overall there are benefits to topic modeling, but as with everthing we need to make sure that we are aware of the data that we are entering and not making overgeneralized conclusions on little information.</p>
